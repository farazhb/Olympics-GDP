    "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The modern Olympics Games vegan in Athens in 1896. The Summer Olympic Games have been taking place every 4 years hosted by different countries ever since the 1896 games, with a few exceptions due to international political disputes. The medal trends of different nations display considerable fluctuations and volatilityies throughout the Olympics history. Influential factors on the athletic performance examined in this study include the economy, represented by a metric in terms of the gross domestic product (GDP) and population of each nations and the hosting of the games. Various other parameters were examined, such as the male/female population ratio, GDP growth, and medical investment; though, their effects were relatively insignificant.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This report studies the correlations among the Olympics performaces according to the medal scores of the countries at the events with external factors of considerable impact on the athletic performance. The most influential determining external factor on the Summer Olympics performance was revealed to be the hosting of the games. Hosts experienced a substantial improvement in their games performance starting a few Olympic events prior to hosting peaking at the event. Though, in most cases, the athletism boost was lost immediately following the games. The analysis of the economy-atheltic trends revealed strong correlations in cases of the majority of the top ranknig nations, particularly of the large-economy countries. The findings of this report enable Olympics performance predictions for the future events of different nations with varying confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Method</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Original Olympics data and transformation: The data for the Summer Olympics beginning with the 1896 Greece games was collected from the open database \"Summer Olympic medallists 1896 to 2008\" from [[1]](#References). A few rows of this table with the columns irrelevant to this study discarded are produced in Table 1. The original database, given in terms of athletes winning The Olympics medals, had to be converted to a country-based table for this study by counting the rows (One medal was attributed to one athelete each row) grouped by year, country, and event. In order to attribute a single medal to a nation per team sport event, such events were identified beforehand in prior process of counting through groups based on the year, discipine, event, and gender, respectively. The data was then supplemented with 2008 and 2016 events gathered and confirmed each Olympic year personally from NBC and CBC television network and Google online coverages. The resulting data was indexed based on the participating countries' International Olympic Committee (IOC) acronyms. Table 2 is a segment of this data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Medal scoring scheme: To study the international Olympics performance, a scalar metric was defined to represent the medal score of each country per Olympic games event. A reasonable formula to define the metric was determined as $\\;4n_{g}+2n_{s}+n_{b}$, where $n_g,\\;n_s,\\;and\\;n_b$ represent the numbers of gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively. This [4,2,1] scoring scheme is intuitively more logical than [1,1,1] (assigning equal values to different medal types, i.e. the total number of medals as score), [1,0,0], and the scheme prioritizing a single medal type at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Changing borders and reattribution: Throughout the history of the Olympic games, international borders have been transformed, significantly in the case of the eastern Europe region. The medal of obsolete IOC titles, were reattributed to the modern representatives of those countries. Reattributions are listed specifically in the corresponding code cell comments. In some cases this transformation resulted in skewed medal counts for the current nation, e.g. Germany received larger medal counts during the 1970s and 1980s. Summed calculated medal counts over the history of the games were compared with actual values at [[2]](#References). A random selection of 10 countries' different medal type counts were accurate to within 2%.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Medal score distributions during epochs: Box-whisker plots were prepared to show the Olympics score distributions during 5 distinct periods or epochs defined, over which the scores were averaged. The periods are delineated by historically significant milestones, and all, except the last, contain equal numbers of Summer games. The periods are {1896-1912, 1920-1936, 1948-1964, 1968-1984, 1988-2016}.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Economy data: The GDP data of the nations were obtained [[3]](#References). The data originally providing information per annum during the period 1960-2015. The metric used to represent the economic data was $\\;\\;GDP\\;/\\;population^{m}\\;$. The power, m, determined as 0.2 after trial and error over the reasonable range, [0,1], considering the best potential fit with the Olympics data. The extremes, absolute GDP and GDP per capita were considered, which, respectively, ranked quite differently relative to the Olympics scores and ranked nations with very small populations highest (many city states at the top) causing mismatch between the top-economy and top-athletic nations. The small m value of 0.2 is reasonable for the economic metric to better correlate with the Olympics scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Correlation and hosting analyses: In order to correlate the economy data with the Olympics scores, the GDP table was grouped over periods prior to each Summer Olympics games event, over which the metric values were averaged. This split-combine formed the basis for the economy data to be compared with the Olympics scores. Over many years, certain countries' GDP data was unavailable. The data for those countries over such periods were omitted from the analysis or plots. In review, the Olympic and economic data were presented as the absolute scores and the global shares of the scores (score divided by the global total that year) of those nations. In review, the Olympic medal score is evaluated as $\\;4n_{g}+2n_{s}+n_{b}$, and the metric used for the economic data is $\\;GDP\\;/\\;pop^{0.2}$. Plots were prepared revealing the correlation among the countries' Olympic and economic trends during the period 1960-2016 for large-economy countries, which were mostly top Olympics ranking nations as well. Fifth-degree polynomials were fit to each trend and plotted with the data to better exhibit the relationship. A polynomial fit is not fundamnetally representative of the nature of the trends displayed, but it reasonably practically follows them in the plotted range and omits irregularities therein, e.g. the boycotting of the Olympics by various countries in the yeas 1976-1984. In addition, the Olympic data was related with the games' hosting information [[4]](#References).\n",

    "<h2><b>Results</b></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><b>Olympic Medal Score Distribitions</b></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Table 2 shows a segment of the countries' medal counts, and Table 3 shows the top 10 ranking countries with medal scores accumulated over the period 1960-2016, the Summer Olympics champions of the modern era. These 10 nations' medal score trends throughout the history of the summer games 1896-2016 are plotted in Figure 1. The x-axis is linear with time, and its tick labels indicate years during which Summer Olympic games were held. The scores' global shares or ratios, i.e. the country's scores' fractions of the total global score each year were used to account for the varying numbers of participants. Figure 2 shows the medal score shares of the top nations. Figures 3 and 4 show the normalized trends of Figures 1 and 2 with respect to the 2016 values of the respective nations. The plots show the volatile nature of the trends owing to different factors including statistic, economic and political (e.g. boycotting of the games by various nations in 1976, 1980, and 1984). Furthermore, the games had low attendance in the first decades, and many countries were joining the games for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The number of participating countries in the games grew gradually from 14 to 206 between the years 1896 and 2016 as shown in Figure 5 [[4]](#References). Most of the top-10 nations exhibit stedy scores overall with evident bright periods. The stably dominant nation has been the US, maintaining a large share of the medal score globally throught the Olympics history, even with the increasing number of countries joining in.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Table 4 shows the fractions of no-medal participating nations during the 5 epochs. The box plots of average medal score distribution during the epochs are produced in Figures 6 and 7. The no-medal countries were excluded from the distributions to allow the log-scale y-axis. Including them results in skewed distributions toward 0 with medians at or near 0. The outliers associated with each box-plot are listed in Tables 5 and 6. The plots do show decreasing median from period to period due to the increasing number of participants with the total global score held relatively with little change. The plots also exhibit narrowing distributions. The drop in median is noticeable most where the rise of the participant number has had the largest rate, at least judging based on the the 5 epochs. The box-whisker portions appear symmetric around the median on the log-scale plots, indicating a more log-normal-like distribtion of the data than a symmetric Gaussian distribution. With the zero-scoring nations included, the medians would skew significantly further toward zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><b>Hosting and performances of nations</b></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Hosting the Olympic games was revealed as the most influential factor on the medal scores, considerably affecting the score trends over 8 years prior to the games, starting about when a nation is selected by the IOC as host. Table 7 lists the hosting nations during the Summer Olympics. Figures 8 a-e show the performances of 1896-2016 host nations in 4-country plot groups, revealing the significance of hosting on their performace. To the credit of the IOC, the scores of hosts rise considerably a few summer games prior to hosting and peak at the event. The trend is not sustained in most cases, however, and reverses dropping the score to the background level the following event. South Korea, The Great Britain, and Australia have shown to be exceptions to this pattern and retain part of the boost. The other exceptions to the pattern include the first few decades of the Olympics history and and of The US and Germany. In the case of Germany the performance appears to rise after its 1972 hosting, an artifact due to the reattribution of East and West Germany's medals to the unified Germany to avoid discontinuity of the nation's trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><b>The Economics and Olympics Scores Correlation</b></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The top countries' score global shares shows reduction during the games' over-century history because of the rising number of medal-winning developing nations joining The Olympics. Tables 8 and 9 show top nations ranked based on 2016 economy and Olympic score data. Global shares of economic and Olympic performance data formed the basis for the correlation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Plots comparing the economic and medal score trends of large-economy nations are shown in Figures 9 a-p. The large-economy-nations exhibit the stronger correlations among the chosen parameters. Figures 10 a-d additionally plot the performances of four nations also high-ranking that exhibit strong correlations. Polynomials of degree 5 fit to the data better exhibit the trends, less sensitive to volatilities and irregularities in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>As mentioned, and as evident in these figures, the top ranking nations show overall downward trends, both economically and athletically, owing to the increasing number of participating nations globally, which the top performers' influence. In most cases, the top ranking nations do display strong economic-athletic correlations. USA, Germany, Great Britain, and Canada display a calm background, gradually weakening with rising participation number screening effect. Around hosting of events, the athletic trend is temporarily excited and peaks relative to the economic trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>China, Italy, Brazil, Korea, Russia, and Mexico show more dynamic correlated trends. China's both metrics begin their rise in the late 1980s. Its Olympics trend is unique in that the nation only began participation in 1984 and has had sharp rise in the performance ever since. Nevertheless, its score dropped relatively slightly atfer the hosting of the Beijing games in 2008. Italy hosted the Summer Olympics in 1960. Beside follwoing that year the trends agree in that they rise until min 1990s after which they reverse slightly. Brazil, one of the BRICS nations, shows rising trends in both cases quite agreeing with regard second time-derivative. While Russia's data is unavailable for years prior to the 1990s, following that time, they correlate well with sub-decade-long fluctuations while the athletic performace shows a gradual decline. Korea's both trends show, following a slowdown until 1968, sharp rise until 2000, after which the rise has slowed. India's athletic data trend based a the few medals won do show agreement with its economic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In th case of a minority of nations, though, the trends show weak correlations, one relatively leading or lagging the other, or no evident connection at all. These include Japan, France, Australia, and Spain, and in the case Netherlands alone the trends appear anticorrelated. In the case of Japan, the economy peaked in 1996, whereas with the Olympics data, after the drop in score following hosting of the Olympics in 1964, the athletic trend has been rising gradually, now sharpening toward its 2020 hosting of the ganes. Jamaica's plot was added out of interest. It exhibits strong athletic performance and rising trend relative to its declining economy share. I believe its sport-focused culture and effective investment in its Olympics performace are causes to the strong medal scores. Notable Jamaican athletes regularly win the gold medals at the events, particularly in track-and-field. Sweden and Colombia also display a strong connection among the economic and Olympic trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Olympics data about countries' performances during the history of the games were studied to reveal influential factors affecting their trends during that time. While, exceptions, data discontinuous, and volatile trends make it difficult to reliably study the potential causes of change, two factors were revealed to substantially do so: The economic trend of the nations and the hosting of the Olympic games.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Economiy data were obtained for the years beginning in 1960. Plotting representative metrics of the performances based on the data with curves fit to them revealed in most cases of the top performers correlated trends. The countries also ranked absolutely similarly for the Olympic and economic performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Also, patterns of peaks relative to the trend backgrounds coincident with the hosting of the games revealed the significant effect of hosting on the Olympics medal scores. These findings may help one predict the results of the upcoming Olympic games with varying confidence for different nations.\n",
